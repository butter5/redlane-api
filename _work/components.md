# Components Documentation

## Overview
This file tracks UI components. As this is a backend API project (Laravel 11), there are no frontend components at this phase.

---

## Backend API Components

### API Structure
This project uses Laravel 11's API-first approach with the following structure:

- **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Resources:** Transform models into JSON responses
- **Requests:** Validate incoming API requests
- **Middleware:** Process requests before reaching controllers

### API Documentation Tool
- **Scribe:** Auto-generates API documentation from annotations
- Accessible at `/docs` endpoint
- Generates Postman collections
- Interactive API testing interface

---

## Future Components

### Admin Dashboard (If Needed)
- Will be tracked here when implemented
- Laravel Nova or custom Vue.js/React SPA
- Separate from main API

### Mobile App Considerations
- Native iOS/Android apps will consume this API
- No components tracked here (separate projects)

---

## Status
✅ COMPLETE - No UI components in Phase 0 (API Backend Only)

**Note:** This file serves as a placeholder following the core documentation structure. It will be populated if/when UI components are added to the project.
